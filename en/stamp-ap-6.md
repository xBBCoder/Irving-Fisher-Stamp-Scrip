of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in General Assembly met, and it is
hereby enacted by the authority of the same, That, when used in this act
the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed
to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different

SECTION 3. When any municipality shall desire to issue scrip certificates
under this act, it shall make application for permission to do so to the

to issue scrip certificates in such amounts and at such times as the Board
may deem proper.

SECTION 4. All scrip certificates shall be printed and distributed to
the respective municipalities by the Commonwealth in the denomination of
one dollar each, and in such form as the Board may determine. Each certificate
shall contain fifty-two (52) spaces for attachment of adhesive stamps hereinafter
provided for, each such space to bear a date one week later than the preceding

SECTION 5. Scrip certificates shall be negotiable. They shall be redeemable
at any time after the last date appearing in the stamp spaces thereon,

shall be provided and sold by the State Treasurer, and he shall make provision
for the sale of the stamps in municipalities which have been authorized
to issue scrip certificates, and elsewhere.

SECTION 8. The State Treasurer shall have authority to appoint agents
for the sale of emergency relief stamps and may deliver stamps to such
agents for sale, but no stamps shall be delivered to any such agent other
than a State bank or a trust company, until the agent shall have furnished
bond satisfactory to the State Treasurer in an amount equal to the face
value of the stamps to be delivered, or shall have deposited with the State
Treasurer securities of the same kind and in the same amount as is now
required by law to be furnished by depositories of State funds.

SECTION 9. Agents for the sale of emergency relief stamps shall keep
all moneys received from such sales separate and apart from all other moneys
and shall deposit them in State banks or trust companies only, in separate
accounts in the name of the Commonwealth. All agents shall remit the proceeds
of stamp sales in each month within five days after the end of the month
to the State Treasurer, after deducting two per centum of the gross amount
of sales, which shall be retained by the agents as their compensation.

SECTION 10. All moneys paid into the State Treasury as proceeds of the
sale of emergency relief stamps shall constitute a special fund to be known

to said fund or as much thereof as shall be necessary, are hereby expressly
appropriated to the State Treasurer for the redemption of scrip certificates
issued under this act, and for the payment into the General Fund of the
cost of preparing and distributing scrip certificates and emergency relief
stamps, provided that not more than two per centum of the face value of
stamps sold may be used for payment of such cost.

more than 2 years, in the discretion of the court.

SECTION 13. The sum of ...... dollars, or as much thereof as may be

and distribution of scrip certificates and stamps issued under the authority
of this act.
