CHAPTER III. STAMP SCRIP DESCRIBED
----------------------------------
STAMP SCRIP is, as hitherto used, a temporary substitute for a part
of the regular currency which has deserted. It is small in amount and short
in duration.

The two points about Stamp Scrip are:

First: It is like money, because it can be banked OR invested OR spent.

Second: It is unlike money, because IT CAN NOT BE HOARDED.

For the stamps, as we shall see, compel Stamp Scrip to "step lively."

A piece of typical Stamp Scrip is shaped more or less like a dollar
bill; but it can not be mistaken for conventional money, because the color
and the design are distinctive. Usually it bears on its face the name of
an exchange or of a business men's association or of a town, according
to which of these is the source of issue in the particular case. But though
the appearance is distinctive, scrip bears prominently a statement of its
denomination, to equalize its purchasing power (by agreement) with the
purchasing power of conventional money. In fact, it is a part of the agreement
that, after a year of circulation, it is to be redeemed in money.

Before turning the scrip over to examine the stamps on the reverse
side, let us consider the circumstances of its issue and how it becomes
injected into the circulation. A typical case is that of a municipality
which issues $1000 in scrip as a sheer addition to the circulating medium
of the town. Its circulation will be entirely local, and the initial use
of it will be to hire a new group of workmen on a new municipal job. Naturally
the town must first get the agreement of the workmen and also that of a
reasonable number of the local merchants from whom the workmen buy their
family supplies - an agreement to the effect that all will accept the scrip
according to its face. It is by no means necessary to get everybody's agreement.
If some of the business houses accept it, the rest will be forced by competition
to do the same; and if a number of people begin to accept it, the others
will accept it because everybody else accepts it.

But this agreement will not readily be forthcoming without a guaranty
from the town that, after a certain period of circulation (usually one
year), the scrip will be redeemed in cold cash. So the town agrees to this,
and sets to work to gather the $1000 of cold cash before the expiration
of the scrip. The town has a year to work in; and it works by means of
what might be called a sort of "ambulatory tax" on the circulation of the
scrip itself.

We now look at the reverse side of the scrip, and there we find a row
of 52 spaces, all dated to indicate the successive Wednesdays of the year.
Each of these spaces provides room for a small adhesive stamp somewhat
resembling a postage stamp. The stamps are sold by the city for 2 cents
each; and it is a part of the plan initially agreed to by all, that no
one can pass the scrip on a Wednesday unless it has, attached to it, the
stamp for that day on the appropriate dated space. Neither can you pass
it if it is in arrears for past Wednesdays - you have to make up the arrears;
for if you try to pass it unstamped, the next recipient will laugh in your
face. He does not propose to be "stuck" by the neglect of previous holders.
Either you have all the stamps on up to date or he is free to refuse the
scrip. Therefore, you not only have the stamps on, but, being as shrewd
as the next man, you have already been as hard on your predecessor as your
successor is prepared to be hard on you. There simply are no arrears.

But if the scrip is duly stamped up to date including the last Wednesday
it will pass freely without any new stamp until next Wednesday.

At the end of the 52 weeks of the allotted year, when a dollar of scrip
returns to the city treasury for redemption, it finds there the $1.04 which
paid for the 52 stamps now carried on the back of the certificate. In short,
when the 1000 dollar issue of scrip thus comes in, it finds $1040 there
ahead of it; and the extra $40 defray the expense of printing the stamps
and of administering the plan.

Thus the scrip is self-liquidating.

Lest, however, the workmen and the trades people may not agree to the
plan unless the town puts up security, the town may do this by a simple
bookkeeping transaction at the bank; that is, it borrows $1000 from the
bank and leaves it in the bank on deposit, to guarantee the scrip-using
public. When, at the end of the allotted year, the scrip is redeemed to
the satisfaction of the bank, the loan is cancelled, and the city is out
nothing. Neither has $1000 of permanent legal tender been withdrawn from
circulation in order to be replaced by the $1000 of temporary Stamp Scrip -
because the bank made it a mere bookkeeping transaction. It did not lock
up the $1000.

There are cases, however, when the legal tender money is actually bundled
up and kept as a guarantee in a safety deposit box in the bank, until the
year is over and the scrip redeemed. But the $1000 of legal tender thus
tied up is a slow-moving currency which everybody has been hoarding, while
the $1000 of scrip which temporarily supplants it is a fleet-footed currency
which nobody can hoard.

Why not? What is the secret of this extra speed on the part of Stamp
Scrip? The secret resides in each stamp due on a Wednesday. You learn to
watch Wednesday coming; and, realizing that Wednesday is tax day, you buy
what you want before that day, on Thursday or Friday or Saturday or Sunday
or Monday or Tuesday - and so does the next recipient, unless you "stick"
him late on Tuesday night. That is, you do your buying, so far as possible,
in the intervals between stamping days (Wednesdays) in order to escape
the 2 cent stamp tax which you would otherwise have to pay.

Of course, if there is nothing which you ought to buy, you can invest
the scrip in any enterprise, or deposit it in any bank, which is a party
to the initial agreement to use the scrip.

Meanwhile the extra speed is of the utmost benefit in a depression
when everyone is afraid to spend real money.

I have spoken of the stamp as constituting a sort of ambulatory tax.
Please note that even the best people always dodge a tax if they honestly
can. Sometimes the effort to dodge has been fatal. In France, for instance,
many years ago, there was a window tax. It led people to build houses with
few windows or even windowless houses, and in consequence, to die of tuberculosis.
They dodged the tax and they did it without dishonesty, but nevertheless
they brought on their own doom. This tax was not only painful but destructive.

In Stamp Scrip we have, for perhaps the first time in history, a tax
which the taxing authority wants to see avoided - by the maximum number
of people. For, by passing the tax on to the next fellow you speed the
scrip, and that is the chief purpose. Moreover, the more you speed it,
the more you divide the burden per capita without in the least diminishing
the return to the city. Suppose, for instance, that a grocer during a certain
week (of six business days) receives and pays out sixty dollars of scrip.
Fifty of these dollars may have come and gone on the five business days
intervening between Wednesdays. Thus he is taxed, not 2 cents per dollar
of sales but perhaps 1/6 of a cents, which amounts, to a sales-tax of one-third
of one per cent on the sales put through with the help of the scrip. And
most of these sales are extra. The grocer is taxed for new business which
only the scrip could bring him. This tax is not only painless but helpful.

The efficiency of money is its volume multiplied by its speed. What
is the speed of scrip? At the very least, the average scrip certificate
will be unloaded twice a week - a speed that is four times the speed of
an average dollar in normal times. In depression times, the average dollar
circulates only about a third as fast as usual so that a turnover of twice
a week becomes twelve times the depression average for conventional money.

This, of course, does not mean that actually 12 times the business
will be done; for Stamp Scrip never becomes a large proportion of the total
circulation. Moreover, a fraction of the conventional currency will withdraw
from circulation in favor of the Scrip.

Thus, the stamp is more like a tax on hoarding than a sales tax. Hoard,
and the tax is heavy; spend (or invest or deposit), and the tax is light.

If the stamp is thus to be likened to a tax, the scrip itself may well
be likened to money. But it were more appropriate, I think, to liken the
scrip to a pre-dated check, issued by the town. It has even been proposed
that the scrip, in small amounts, be given away to needy folk, or to everybody,
in which case, though it would be a gift to the first recipients, it would
really be a loan to the public as a whole -a loan to the public by the
public. In any view, the scrip goes out and comes back and is cancelled
like a check, except that it passes through more hands and without endorsement.

Nor is it a case of something for nothing. It is a case of a restored
transfer belt, transferring not something for nothing, but goods for goods,
goods for services, services for goods.

Charles Zylstra, the enterprising man who first introduced Stamp Scrip
to America (in a small western town) tells this story. A travelling salesman
stopped at a hotel and handed the clerk a hundred dollar bill to be put
in the safe, saying he would call for it in twenty-four hours. The clerk,
whose name was A, owed $100 to B and clandestinely he used this bill for
the liquidation of his debt, thinking that before the expiration of 24
hours he could collect $100 from his own debtor, whose name was Z. So this
100 dollar bill went to B, who, greatly surprised, used it to pay his own
100 dollar debt to one C, who (equally surprised) . . . and so on, and
so on, all the way down to Z, who, with much pleasure, returned the bill
to A, the clerk, who, in the morning, restored it to the salesman. And
then did A, the clerk, stand petrified with horror to see the salesman
light a cigar with it.

"Counterfeit," said the salesman, "a fake gift from a crazy friend,
Abner; but he didn't put it over, did he?"

Let us now look at the collective result. At the end of the year, the
town has a new street, paid for with scrip which (through the stamps) was
paid for by the citizens who used the scrip - and will use the street too.

The scrip cost the citizens perhaps 1/3 of 1 per cent on mostly new
business, while the street cost the city (in the sense of the city treasury)
nothing at all. But, of course, the city is the citizens; so that these
various statements boil down to this: The citizens have bought a new street
out of a self imposed tax on mostly new business, and it was a tax less
heavy and more spread out than any other tax they ever paid.

The chief objection to Stamp Scrip which I have thus far encountered
is that it will not work because people will refuse it - it will not catch
hold. But the man who said this, said later, "I guess I must be like the
Englishman a hundred years ago, who said that the steam-locomotive couldn't
work because smooth wheels could not catch on to smooth rails. While he
was saying this in London, Stephenson was successfully running his locomotive
in Scotland." Very often people are saying of a certain thing, "it can't
be done" at the very moment that somebody else is doing it.

Let us look now at the existing evidence that Stamp Scrip has caught
on and has worked per schedule.
