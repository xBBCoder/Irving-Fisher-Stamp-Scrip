ГЛАВА II. МЕНОВОЕ ДВИЖЕНИЕ В 1933 ГОДУ
--------------------------------------
### THE MOVIES
THOSE who go often to the "movies" must have seen Marie Dressler as
a bank president, or Chic Sale as a small-town grocer, each promoting a
scheme of barter. If proof were needed that overproduction is not the cause
of the depression, barter is the proof - or some of the proof. It shows
goods not over-produced but dead-locked for want of a circulating transfer-belt
called "money." Many a dealer sits down in puzzled exasperation, as he
sees about him a market wanting his goods, and well stocked with other
goods which he wants and with able-bodied and willing workers, but without
work and therefore without buying power. Says A, "I could use some of B's
goods; but I have no cash to pay for them until someone with cash walks
in here!" Says B, "I could buy some of C's goods, but I've no cash to do
it with till someone with cash walks in here." Says the job hunter, "I'd
gladly take my wages in trade if I could work them out with A and B and
C who among them sell the entire range of what my family must eat and wear
and burn for fuel - but neither A nor B nor C has need of me - much less
could the three of them divide me up." Then D comes on the scene, and says,
"I could use that man! - if he'd really take his pay in trade; but he says
he can't play a trombone and that's all I've got for him."

"Very well," cries Chic or Marie, "A's boy is looking for a trombone
and that solves the whole problem, and solves it without the use of a dollar.
The world's first market had nothing but goods and able bodies, but it
didn't refuse to function on that account. Let's go. We'll exchange goods
for goods, service for service, goods for service and service for goods."

All very well for that particular case; but it was the playwright who
constructed it to suit his pattern. In the real life of the twentieth century,
the handicaps to barter on a large scale are practically insurmountable.
A desk maker, if he wants a ton of coal, would almost have to dump his
desk in a hand-barrow and trundle it about till he met a coal dealer whose
crying need happened to be a desk.

Therefore Chic or somebody organizes an Exchange Association, with
a register in which are noted what can be supplied by whom and who wants
what.

### SWAPPING BEGINS
So much for the movies which do not always reflect real life.

Nevertheless, in the real life of this depression, and culminating
apparently in 1933, precisely what I have just described has been taking
place. First the farmers, finding themselves in possession of goods which
they wanted to get rid of, and in sight of goods which they wanted to acquire,
but also finding themselves almost entirely without the money needed to
effect the exchanges, began to effect the exchanges unconventionally -
they "swapped." First they swapped goods for goods. But they needed farm-hands
too; so they repaired to the near villages, sought out the unemployed and
began to swap goods for service. The unemployed themselves then took up
the idea, and soon a sort of self-help movement, principally under the
initiative of the unemployed, was on its way to a larger and larger cross-section
of the population. A few months ago it was estimated that 250 thousand
people were depending in whole or in part upon barter; and today the estimate
is more like a million. Before these words, written at top speed, reach
the printer, even this last figure may be outdated. A short time ago there
were said to be 200 barter exchanges scattered among 30 states. At this
writing the estimate, as printed in the New York Times (1), is more like
400; and no doubt this figure too will soon be out-dated.

Finally, the Mid West Exchange (founded by President Arthur Morgan
of Antioch College), (2) and also an eastern exchange (The Emergency Exchange
Association of New York City), have both become engaged in a plan to organize
a nation-wide "hook-up" of exchanges, for the purpose of exchanging their
regional surpluses.

### PROGRESS IN THE METHODS OF SWAPPING
The most rudimentary form of barter is perhaps that of the farmers at
county fairs, where most of the goods and all of the dealers are in plain
sight.

Next comes the Exchange Warehouse, which you can visit alone, on isolated
occasions, taking what you have and seeking what you want.

Then comes the "Swap Bulletin."

Next the "Swap-Ad" appears; for the newspapers have taken the cue,
and turned their "want columns" into "swap columns." "Get Swap Minded".
says the Meriden Record. And the advertiser responds (these are actual
cases):

"Swap: Radio Loudspeaker for Auto Clear Vision Mirror. Telephone 2501."

"Swap: Townsend Snow Plow, hand or motor drawn; Ideal for clearing
Service Station property; swap for gasoline and oil. Phone 1205."

"Swap: Seven room Shore Cottage at one of Connecticut's finest beaches,
for a Farm."

"Swap: Man's Overcoat, in good condition, for Slide Trombone, Piccolo,
or French Horn" (and I read this one after inventing my own trombone illustration!).

But even warehouses, bulletins and the press were not sufficiently
convenient. They had to be supplemented by warehouse receipts, which can
pass from hand to hand.

Finally, since money, however scarce, does still exist, some of the
Exchange Associations conceived the idea of printing their certificates
in money-denominations. By agreement, a dollar receipt does whatever a
dollar would do if you had a dollar. These certificates have even been
loaned by the associations issuing them.

Perhaps the best example of such paper is to be found at Yellow Springs,
Ohio, where some of the students of Antioch College use it to help pay
not only their living expenses but their tuition, having earned the paper
in any one of many places, just as they would earn more conventional money.

It becomes more and more evident that, if there were no money, 1933
could invent it all over again; and since Uncle Sam has developed a seeming
incapacity to supply enough of it for even that amount of trade which is
indispensable to keep his citizens from foraging like animals (or thieves),
invention has reached the very threshold of money.

This brings me to the Stamp Scrip idea, invented in Europe and now
spreading in America independently of the Swap idea. I hope the two will
coalesce, and solve the "hook-up" problem, both for general reasons expressed
in the foreword and also for the practical advantages listed in the appendix.
