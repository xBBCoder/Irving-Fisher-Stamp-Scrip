The backs of said certificates shall be prepared in such manner as to indicate
clearly the proper place for affixing each stamp contemplated herein, to
the end that on the second Wednesday after the issuance of said certificates
from the Treasury the first stamp shall be affixed, and thereafter on each
Wednesday until a total of 52 stamps shall be affixed; and said certificates
in the spaces designated for affixing said stamps shall set forth the day
of the month and year when each such stamp shall be atfixed, as for example:

"On April 5, 1933, affix 2-cent stamp here."

The face of said certificates shall set forth substantially the following:

"This certificate is legal tender for $1 for payment of all debts and
dues, public and private, customs, duties, and taxes: Provided, That on
the date of its transfer there shall be affixed 2-cent postage stamps for
all dates prior to such date of transfer, as set forth in the schedule
on the back hereof. When fifty-two 2-cent postage stamps shall have been
affixed this certificate shall be redeemable at any post office for $1
lawful money of the United States."

(a) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized in his discretion to
issue the certificates directed to be issued hereunder in monthly or semimonthly
installments, all of like tenor and effect except that the schedule for
the affixing of the stamps on the back of said certificate shall bear dates
for the affixing of stamps appropriate to the date of the issue of each
such installment of certificates.

(b) When such certificates appropriately stamped in full shall be presented
to the Secretary of the Treasury for redemption he shall certify to the
Postmaster General from time to time the amount of certificates so presented
for redemption, and the Postmaster General shall thereupon pay to the Secretary
of the Treasury out of the funds arising from the sale of stamps the sum
of one dollar for each such certificate so redeemed, whereupon said certificates
shall be destroyed.

(c) Prior to the issuance of the first installment of certificates
hereunder the Secretary of the Treasury is directed, by posters to be hung
in post offices and other public places, and by advertising in newspapers
and magazines, to advise the public of the contemplated issue of these
certificates, with appropriate directions to the public with reference
to the affixing of stamps, the legal tender quality of the certificates,
their redemption feature, and all such similiar information. There is hereby
appropriated for the use of the Secretary of the Treasury to defray the
cost of such advertising the sum of $100,000.

(d) When such certificates shall have been issued by the Secretary
of the Treasury the person holding the same on and after 12:01 o'clock
antemeridian of the first Wednesday set forth in the schedule on the back
of said certificates, shall affix in the spice therein provided a 2-cent
postage stamp of the United States. Prior to such time said certificates
in the hands of all holders shall be legal tender for the payment of all
debts for the sum of $1. After affixing the first stamp said certificate
shall be legal tender as aforesaid for the payment of all debts until the
following Wednesday when another 2-cent postage stamp of the United States
shall be affixed by the person holding the same prior to 12:01 o'clock
antemeridian of such Wednesday, and thereafter for 50 consecutive additional
Wednesdays like postage stamps shall be affixed by the holders. At all
times when there shall be affixed all such postage stamps as are required
to be affixed on the back of such certificates prior to the date of transfer,
such certificates shall be legal tender as aforesaid for the sum of $1.
When fifty-two 2-cent stamps shall have been affixed on the back thereof
the holder may present the same to any post office in the United States
for redemption, and the same shall be redeemed by such post office in any
present lawful money of the United States. All post offices in the United
States are hereby charged with the duty of making such redemption and of
forwarding such certificates for cancellation to the Secretary of the Treasury.

(e) With respect to such certificates as shall become unfit, through
use, for further circulation, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Postmaster
General are authorized and directed to provide for the exchange of such
worn-out certificates for new certificates, and to make all regulations
required for that purpose.

(f) It is declared to be against the public policy of the United States
to provide in any contract executed subsequent to the date of this act
that the certificates to be issued under this act, or any like issue, shall
not be received in the discharge of such contract, and all such provisions
in such contracts are hereby declared null and void.

(g) Said certificates, when accepted by the Government, shall be promptly
reissued by any department or agency of the Government receiving the same.

(h) In transactions of less than $1 such certificates are not legal
tender unless stamped by the person tendering the same for one additional
week after tender.

(i) Banks of deposit receiving such certificates as deposits may charge
2 cents for each certificate so deposited as a service charge.

(j) The Secretary of the Treasury and the Postmaster General are authorized
to promulgate regulations for carrying out the provisions of this act.

(k) If and when the wholesale commodity price level of all commodities,
included by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in computing index numbers of
wholesale prices, shall equal 80 per cent of the average index number for
the year 1926, then anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, the
Secretary of the Treasury is directed to discontinue the issuance of certificates
hereunder, and such certificates as are then outstanding shall be retired
as the same are presented for redemption or replacement of worn-out certifcates.

(l) Five hundred million dollars of the amount made available under
section 2 of this act shall be apportioned among the States on the basis
of population according to the fifteenth decennial census. This amount
is made available as herein provided in addition to the amount made available
to the States under section 4 (a) of this act. The amount so apportioned
to the States shall be delivered to the governor of the State applying
for the apportionment made to his State, upon application being made therefor
by the governor. The amount apportioned to a State shall be administered
within the State under rules and regulations adopted by the governor thereof
and through such agencies as he may establish. The amount apportioned to
a State may be by the governor thereof apportioned to the counties, and/or
to the municipalities of said State, and may be used in construction work
or for emergency relief as defined in section II of this act.(1)

(1) The above extracts are from the amendments offered be Senator Bankhead
to the Costigan-LaFollette unemployment relief bill (S.5125) considered
but not passed by the last (72nd) congress. Afterwards these amendments
with some changes and additions were made into a separate bill (S. 5674
which was identical with Congressman Pettengill's bill H. R. 14757). Still
later, in the present (73rd) congress, Senator Bankhead reintroduced this
bill as S. 242. As finally drawn the bill aims to use the stamp feature
not only for emergency relict but also for stabilization purposes. Congressman
Pettengill's speech on his bill is referred to in the appendix.
