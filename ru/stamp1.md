CHAPTER I. REASON FOR THIS BOOK
-------------------------------
STAMP SCRIP is not a panacea. My diagnosis of the depression and my
remedial suggestions for it may be found in "Booms and Depressions," recently
off the press. (1) That is a small enough book, but by no means as small
as this one which selects a minor point for special treatment. For, at
this juncture of our economic difficulties, a minor point seems to me to
have become a key point. Also it has become a sensation by reason of the
recent spread of the stamp scrip idea throughout this country. With the
help of Mr. Hans R. L. Cohrssen I have recently answered four or five hundred
inquiries about it. The letters come from literally every state in the
union, and are written by persons, largely in official positions, who have
a practical interest in introducing Stamp Scrip in their several towns,
cities and states.

But Stamp Scrip has two basic forms, and the one which happened to
establish itself in this country as a precedent, is, in my opinion, the
wrong one of the two. Partly to help change the precedent, partly to help
spread the idea over a wider territory, partly to provide a "manual" for
those who are trying and are yet to try to work out the practical application
of the idea to their respective regions, and partly to simplify the task
of handling a correspondence which seems to grow by leaps and bounds -
for all these purposes, I have prepared this little book.

There is one other purpose: to unleash a force on which the ultimate
cure of the depression really depends. I refer to the credit currency of
the land which is now so tragically bottled up and has hitherto baffled
the most heroic efforts at rescue. It has simply refused to be rescued -
refused with an apparently insane perversity.

Why did we, last June, start to recover and then fail so ignominiously?
I venture to think it was for the lack of just such an agent as Stamp Scrip.

The movement began with the small towns for purely local purposes.
Perhaps, therefore, as an unexpected sequel, the small towns are to get
the glory, not precisely of rescuing the credit currency of the land, but
of "priming the pump" which shall enable that currency at last to gush
forth - after which Stamp Scrip, having fully performed ist temporary and
incidental office, can automatically retire.

I am indebted to the "New Republic" for permission to reprint a large
part of Mr. Hans R. L. Cohrssen's article on "Wara."(2)

I am indebted to Mr. Cohrssen for the same favor, and for his assistance
in assembling the elements of the book.

And I am indebted to my brother, Herbert Wescott Fisher, for rearranging
these elements, and splicing and unifying them, in a few days of fast and
furious work.
