### III. SUGGESTED FORMS
#### Prospectus
Adopted from form used by Mr. H. C. Parmelee, Fort Smith, Ark.

#### The Stamp Scrip Plan
Stamp Scrip is originated and put into practise for the purpose of providing
unemployment relief, and to stimulate trade. As a new, painless tax paid
from new, additional profits it affords a means of relief from other forms
of taxing for unemployment relief purposes, and distributes such tax payments
over a wider area.

The Stamp Scrip plan is put in effect as a number of people-grocery
stores, dry-goods stores, clothing stores, butcher shops, hardware stores,
mechanics, garages, bakeries, doctors, lawyers, dentists, beauty parlors,
real-estate owners, farmers, plumbers, laborers, lumber-yards, etc. - mutually
agree that they will accept this substitute for legal tender in all the
trades they are able to make among themselves.

Stamp Scrip wail resemble an ordinary bank bill. It will have the denomination
stamped on its face. On the back of the bill, however, will appear 52 small
squares.

Each square will have a date on the inside. These dates will be for
some particular day of the week (say Wednesday) for 52 weeks of the year.

Suppose you were to receive one of these new dollars on Thursday. By
reason of the agreement already made, you could spend this dollar for anything
you needed with any of the dozens of people previously mentioned. It would
pass for a full dollar on every day up until the following Wednesday, which
is, let us say, February 8th.

On that day you must purchase from the central office, or elsewhere
where offered for sale, a special stamp put out by the central office.
For this stamp you must pay 2 cents in legal tender. If you do not this,
the next man need not accept your scrip dollar for more than 98 cents.

Whoever holds the scrip dollar on Wednesday must put on of these special
2-cent stamps. When it has circulated for the 52 weeks of the year, the
central office has collected $1.04 in legal tender money.

This money has been kept in a special fund. Now the man who receives
the dollar with 51 stamps on it may place a 2-cent stamp in the last square,
take it to the central office and receive a legal tender dollar in place
of it.

Thus it is self-redeeming because as it travels from week to week,
it accumulates each week 2-cents which, multiplied by the weeks of the
year, will provide 100 cents in legal tender money to take it up - with
4 cents left over.

This 2% tax is not a 2% sales tax. The stamp needs to be put on but
once a week. During the week the dollar may enable 10 or 20 transactions
to take place. The tax for that week would be only 2 cents divided by the
number of times it changed hands.

You cannot hold the Stamp Scrip bill, unless you pay 2 cents each week.
The 2-cent stamp is a 2% tax on hoarding. It will be the tendency to get
rid of the dollar and let the other fellow put on the tax.

This will help to speed business up. It makes things move very briskly.
In ordinary times legal tender money turns over once or every two weeks.
In depressions it turns over much more slowly. Hoarded money doesn't turn
over at all. Self redeeming scrip money would doubtless turn over several
times each week.

Stamp Scrip may be put into circulation in several different ways:

1. The City may issue it in payment of wages, salaries or materials.
It may be used in these ways in lieu of taxes. The citizens by agreeing
to accept it, virtually buy it from the city and pay their taxes in small
installments at the rate of 2 cents on the dollar each week. The City of
Evanston, Ill. is using it in this way. The City of Hawarden, Ia., first
introduced it in this manner. Many other cities are so using it.

2. The Stamp Scrip may also be loaned to merchants. They agree to pay
their loans at a later date in scrip, without interest. They may use it
to pay wages, local bills, etc.

3. Stamp Scrip may also be safely loaned to others, preferably for
purposes that would put unemployed people to work and thus place needed
purchasing power in their hands.

A building owner might borrow some of the scrip and hire idle carpenters,
plumbers, painters and masons to repair a building.

A farmer might borrow some of it with which to have a truck repaired
at the garage so that he might haul his crops to the market.

The loans could be safely made to reputable persons, known to pay their
debts, without the security required by a bank.

Its effect upon ordinary money is to bring more legal tender money
back into circulation. A great deal of legal tender money is being hoarded
because people are afraid they can't get more of it. When something that
performs all the functions of money begins to get plentiful, people lose
their fear and put their legal tender dollars to work.

It also tends to unlock bank credit. The Stamp Scrip is injected into
the consuming end of the economic circle. It begins to get action at once.
Demand is created. Goods are taken off of shelves - begin to get used up.

Then there is a genuine need for production to start again. The merchant
and manufacturer now find the banks bulging with credit, and the banks
are eager to loan them credit.

The credit made available by the banks and the Federal Reserve, etc.
must start from the producing end. This is a long way from the consumer.
The consumer can't get hold of any kind of credit the banks and Federal
Reserve control.

The Stamp Scrip plan permits this consumer to get credit - money -
which he can get in no other way. Production can't start again until consumption
begins to make way for new goods.

#### FORM OF PETITION
In Hawarden the following petition was circulated among the merchants
and presented to the city officials:

"TO THE HONORABLE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF ..................

of trying ways and means of relieving hardships and stagnant conditions,

at the time of cashing same for merchandise or services.(2)
