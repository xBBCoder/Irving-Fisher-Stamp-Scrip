### IV. МАРОЧНЫЕ СЕРТИФИКАТЫ, АДАПТИРОВАННЫЕ К ЧРЕЗВЫЧАЙНОЙ СИТУАЦИИ В РЕДИНГЕ, ПЕНСИЛЬВАНИЯ
#### Автор - Хэнс Р.Л.Кохрссен
Торговая палата выпустила определенное количество датируемых марочных сертификатов для города, школьного совета, округа,
заводов и торговцев. На сумму выпуска для города, округа и школьного совета Торговая палата получила ордера ожидаемого
налога в качестве залога. Сертификаты, передаваемые предприятиям и прочим для увеличения занятости, должны были
оплачиваться наличными или чеками. Сертификаты были выпущены в номиналах по 50 центов и $1.00. Первая наклейка марок
должна было производиться 5 апреля, но было решено начать приклеивать марки через три или четыре недели после выпуска.
Причины, по которым сертификаты начали обращаться без марок, были следующими: (a) выпуск заменителей денег осуществлялся
в момент, когда сами денег были недоступны, и (b) чтобы обеспечить общее признание сертификатов и выиграть время для
подготовки общества к будущей наклейке марок путем информационной кампании.

Вырученные от этого выпуска средства должны использоваться, в первую очередь, для того, чтобы помочь беднякам решить
проблему безработицы, а также для нужд города, округа, школьного совета и налогоплательщиков.

Торговая палата создала также центр клирингового обслуживания, который работает двумя способами:

##### 1. Центральный клиринговый офис
Центральный клиринговый офис принимает сертификаты от местных розничных торговцев и оптовиков, которые не могут
использовать их для покупок за пределами города. Эти сертификаты передаются местным производителям, которые
расплачиваются за них иногородними чеками или наличностью, которые в свою очередь передаются местным розничным
торговцам. Таким же образом избыточные сертификаты забираются из банков.

##### 2. Отделения клирингового офиса (3)
Банки Рединга принимают сертификаты на депозиты от торговцев и прочих, и сразу же передают их другим своим клиентам,
оказывая предпочтение тем, кто соглашается потратить определенное количество сертификатов на создание рабочих мест.
Любые излишки, которые банки не могут немедленно распределить, отдаются в Центральный клиринговый офис. В случае, если
некто, не имеющий постоянного счета, хочет обменять сертификаты на деньги, банки имеют право взимать компенсационный
сбор в размере 4%. Сертификатные депозиты хранятся банками на специальных сертификатных счетах. После того, как все
сертификаты будут изъяты из обращения, эти счета будут преобразованы в обычные счета, за что банк возьмет специальную
пошлину. В случае, если банк не имеет возможности обслуживать транзакции в сертификатах, он может разрешить Торговой
палате создать в своих отделениях "окна сертификатов" для проведения операций центра клирингового обслуживания.

На лицевой стороне купюр сертификатов размещена следующая информация:

#### "РЕДИНГ, ПЕНСИЛЬВАНИЯ. БАНКНОТА МАРОЧНОГО СЕРТИФИКАТА"
Выпущена Торговой палатой Рединга для обращения в торговле по номинальной стоимости и может приниматься в уплату налогов
вплоть до дальнейшего распоряжения от города Рединг, округа Беркс и школьного округа Рединг.

Выкупается по номинальной стоимости, когда на оборотную сторону будет наклеено 52 специальные "Марки безработных
Рединга", но не позже 5 мая 1934.

Марки продаются во всех магазинах, обозначенных соответствующими надписями.

На оборотной стороне имеется 52 ячейки с датами 52-х подряд идущих сред одного года начиная со среды 5 апреля. На
однодолларовых банкнотах в этих ячейках также напечатано "2", а на пятидесятицентовых - "1". Эти банкноты должны быть
немного больше, чем обычные однодолларовые банкноты.

#### ОПЕРАТИВНЫЙ ПЛАН
Первый выпуск планируется довольно большим, чтобы удовлетворить срочные потребности в выплате заработной платы. Город,
округ и школьный совет получат большие суммы из этого выпуска в счет задолженностей по налогам и т.д. Часть этих
сертификатов они снова используют для выплат заработной платы. Все излишки они могут передать в клиринговый центр,
который отдаст за них соответствующую сумму залога.

Another large portion will go to local retailers who will deposit it
at their banks. Through the banks it comes in part to the Central Clearing
House, that part goes to the Clearing House which could not immediately
be exchanged by the banks into cash received from local manufacturers for
payrolls. This excess over the amount which can comfortably be kept in
constant circulation within the community will be exchanged by the Clearing
House for the (perhaps temporarily frozen) collateral received at the beginning.

Thus any amount which was originally issued in excess of local requirements
will be retired automatically.

After "stamping" has started we may expect that the scrip will move
at greatly increased velocity as everyone will want to avoid the stamp
tax. Besides stimulating business this will also reduce the volume of outstanding
scrip considerably. The amount of stamp scrip which can be carried through
a period of one year depends entirely upon the cooperation of the community,
on the part of labor to accept it in payrolls, the merchants to accept
it for goods and the Clearing House Service to prevent anyone from getting
overloaded. It is desirable that public sentiment be aroused in order to
carry through a large issue and thus get the greatest possible benefit
for the relief of unemployment. It depends, of course, how the national
currency situation will develop within the next few weeks or months to
determine whether stamp scrip is merely an addition to ordinary currency
for stimulation of trade and poor relief, or whether it will constitute
the major part of the local circulating medium.

#### PLEDGES
In order to work the plan successfully pledges should be solicited from
the following. (Of course, it will not be necessary to have everyone signed
up. It is sufficient to have the leading men in each field; the rest will
follow without much thinking or will be forced to follow for reasons of
competition.)

1. Labor is to accept scrip in wages. Percentage according to conditions, but not less than 20%.
2. Retail merchants are to accept it at face value in payment for goods.
3. Manufacturers are to pay it to labor to the extent to which the laborer is willing to accept but not less than 20%, and to take it off, the Clearing House hands regularly.
4. City, County and School Board are to accept it for taxes and use it in payrolls not less than 20%. Municipal employees are to accept it in salaries and wages not less than 20%.
5. Banks are to accept it on deposits as outlined above and are to aid in the Clearing House Service.

#### PLEDGE FOR LABOR CROUP
"We, the undersigned, agree and pledge the members of ........

to accept part or whole of our wages in Reading Stamp Scrip. We understand
that by accepting a minimum of 20% of our wages in stamp scrip (and this
might be up to 100% at times) for the period of one year, we help ourselves
and our fellow workers towards more work and better conditions. We urge
upon our fellow workers the following of our example."

#### PLEDGE FOR MERCHANTS, PROFESSIONAL MEN AND CONTRACTORS
"We, the undersigned, agree to accept in trade for goods and services
rendered or work done 'Reading Stamp Scrip' at face value. We also pledge
full support to make this issue of stamp scrip a success by displaying
educational signs, distributing literature, and displaying signs 'Reading

##### For Stores Only
"We also agree to sell Reading Unemployment Relief Stamps which we shall
buy from the Reading Chamber of Commerce for cash paid in advance."

#### PLEDGE FOR MANUFACTURERS
"We, the undersigned, pledge ourselves to buy from the Chamber of Commerce
or from our banks for cash, part or whole of our weekly payrolls (to the
extent to which labor is willing to accept it) 'Reading Stamp Scrip.'"

"We understand that Stamp Scrip will stimulate local trade, reduce
the burden of taxation and bring relief to the poor."

At this writing the actual operating of Stamp Scrip in Reading has not
yet been started. All preparations have been made. One of the local banks,
the Berks County Trust Company whose president, Mr. J. Turner Moore, is
Chairman of the Operating Committee, has turned over to the Committee an
empty bank building which is planned to be "Scrip-Headquarters." The Operating
Committee will also appoint the employees of "Scrip-Headquarters." The
following is a circular suggested to be printed and distributed in large
quantities to the citizens of Reading.

#### READING-BERKS COUNTY STAMP SCRIP
Why? When President Roosevelt declared a national bank holiday and closed
all banks, Reading-Berks County, like the rest of the country, was left
without a medium of exchange. This bank holiday is not yet determined,
and even if it were, business conditions as well as the unemployment situation
in Reading and Berks County must be helped. Therefore, the issuance of
a supplementary local medium of exchange of "Stamp Scrip" has been effected.

By What Authority? Under pressure from local business men, manufacturers,
and banks, the directors of the Reading Chamber of Commerce authorized
its officers to prepare for and effect the issue "Stamp Scrip" as outlined
in a plan especially adapted for this community by Mr. Hans R. L. Cohrssen.
The plan had been approved by a group of representative citizens who met
on Sunday night, March 5th. This action was dictated by the need of the
community:

Manufacturers were anxious to pay their workers in scrip as they learned
they could not obtain cash;

Merchants were anxious to see trade continue inn spite of a shortage
of cash; Labor simply could not afford to work and go without pay at the
end of the week.

Thus, necessity was the prime factor in the plan to issue Stamp Scrip.

Who Will Operate the Plan? The President of the Chamber of Commerce
has appointed an Operating Committee consisting of 10 bankers and 2 business
men to operate the Stamp Scrip plan. This assures the utmost efficiency
and competence, as the same men will handle the scrip who ordinarily take
care of money in this community. They know best how to transact the various
phases of the plan which are all essentially of a banking nature; they
are best acquainted with the financial needs of this community, so as to
give the best advice that can be had in any case.

This is the list of the members of the Operating Committee:

MR. MYRON H. CLARK Vice-Pres., Reading Iron Co.  
MR. A. H. SMITH, Topton Berks County Bankers Assn.  
MR. D. C. KERSTETTER, Hamburg Berks County Bankers Assn.  
MR. L. M. RUTH, Wernersville Berks County Bankers Assn.  
MR. S. C. HOUCK, Boyertown Berks County Bankers Assn.  
MR. GEO. D. SNYDER Secretary Reading Clearing House & Berks Cty. Bankers Assn.  
MR. HENRY B. HAGY Pres. Penna. Trust Co.  
MR. J. TURNER MOORE Pres. Berks County Trust Co.  
MR. GEORGE R. HOWELL Pres. Reading Trust Co.  
MR. CHARLES T. CUBELLIS Assistant to the Pres. Farmers National Bank & Trust Co.  
MR. HANS GRAMM  
MR. WALTER G. WADE Pres. Peoples Trust Co.

This Operating Committee has set up a Scrip Clearing Service to perform
the usual functions of a clearing house.

Who Can Get Scrip, and How? Any one who desires to get scrip may fill
out an application at Scrip-Headquarters 308 Penn Street, for his needs.
The Operating Committee will pass on this application before allowing the
issuance of any scrip. The Operating Committee has determined to give scrip
under the following conditions:

(1) To depositors holding savings accounts in any Reading or Berks County
Bank or Trust Company up to onehalf the amount of the deposit, conditioned
upon surrender of the pass book, and the earmarking by the bank holding
the deposit of double the amount of savings

(2) To holders of check-accounts up to 50% of their balance upon presentation
of an assignment on which is certified that the double amount has been
earmarked against the withdrawal of scrip

(3) To manufacturers and other payers of wages upon transfer of negotiable
collateral to be passed upon by the Operating Committee

(4) To the City of Reading, the County of Berks, and the Reading School
District upon depositing anticipation tax warrants with the Operating Committee
and subject to such other conditions and security as may be determined
by the Operating Committee

(5) To all citizens upon delivery of other security, at the discretion
of the Operating Committee.

How Does Scrip Look? Reading-Berks County Stamp Scrip comes in denominations
of 50¢, $1 $5 and $10. The 50 cent bill is yellow, the $1 bill is green,
the $5 bill is rose and the $10 bill is blue. It is printed on especially
secured safety paper. When holding the bills against the light you will
detect the watermarks. Protect yourself by looking at the watermarks before
accepting any doubtful looking bills, or if you are still in doubt you
may come to Scrip-Headquarters for verification. The reverse side of a
bill is divided into 52 spaces in which the dates of the 52 Wednesdays
of a year are printed.

How to Use. When you receive Stamp Scrip in your payroll or in payment
of a bill you may accept it without any hesitation. Each scrip bill is
fully backed by ample collateral - it represents the same value as your
ordinary money bills. (You have seen above by what collateral it is backed.)
Take your scrip to your merchant, grocer, department store to buy whatever
you need. Almost every business in Reading has agreed to accept Stamp Scrip
in trade. The City of Reading, the County of Berks, and the Reading School
District have also agreed to accept it in payment of taxes due them. Look
at the signs: "Reading-Berks County Scamp Scrip Accepted Here." If you
do not want to spend your scrip, but want to save it, you may open a Scrip
Savings Account at Scrip-Headquarters. Ask for further information there.

How About the Stamps? Until Wednesday, April 5th you will not have to
think of the stamps. Beginning on that date a special "Reading Unemployment
Relief Stamp" amounting to 2% of the face value of the bills has to be
affixed on each Wednesday by the holder of a bill into the space dated
for that particular Wednesday. Stamps may be purchased at all stores displaying
sign. After a bill has been fully stamped it will be redeemed at face value
at Scrip-Headquarters. When depositing Stamp Scrip in a Scrip Savings Account
or with the Scrip Clearing Service it must be stamped with the next stamp
due.

Why Stamps? There are a number of important reasons for the stamping
of the scrip:

First, as we have seen, stamping self-liquidates the scrip; it makes
the scrip pay for itself. This means also that each stamp on a scrip bill
is security added to the collateral which has already been placed behind
the scrip.

Second, there will be a profit from the operation of the Stamp Scrip
plan which will be given over to unemployment relief after the costs of
operating the plan have been paid, and all outstanding scrip has been redeemed.

And third, the stamping puts speed behind the circulation of the scrip.
As each one wants to avoid the affixing of stamps, he passes his bills
on very quickly, and so does everybody else. In other words, stamping makes
the scrip more effective as a medium of exchange; it stimulates business;
it wipes out debts.

Another advantage of the quick circulation of the Stamp Scrip is that
only a small quantity is needed to transact as much business and do as
much good as a many times larger issue of slowly circulating medium. It
goes without saying that the smaller your scrip issue is, the easier it
is to handle and to redeem; it is a smaller responsibility for the Operating
Committee and for the community.

Other plans have been made for publicity, such as explanations and
addresses by members of the Operating Committee over the local radio station.
A Speaker Committee has been formed and the training of a number of men
to, explain the plan is contemplated. The teachers in particular are to
be instructed in explaining the plan to their classes.

Some of the policies of the Operating Committee have not yet been decided
on; for instance, whether it would be possible for the Committee to issue
its own negotiable papers to the merchants who deposit scrip with the Scrip
Clearing Service. The manufacturers' negotiable papers received for scrip
would then be sent out directly for clearing by the Scrip Clearing Service.
This would simplify scrip clearing, as it would permit the Scrip Clearing
House to give the merchants negotiable papers reading for the same amount
of dollars as they have deposited in scrip.

Another point is "Premature Cash Redemption," or exchange of scrip
into dollars at any time. The redemption fee has not yet been decided on.

(3) On account of the emergency directions issued by the Secretary of
the Treasury, prohibiting banks to handle scrip, banks were unable to cooperate
to that extent. This has been met in Reading by setting up "Scrip Headquarters."
See explanation on the following pages.

(4) Called upon to approve of the plan as presented by the Chamber
of Commerce authorizing the President of the Chamber of Commerce to appoint
an Operating Committee to put plan into effect if needed.
