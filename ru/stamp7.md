ГЛАВА VII. В ОТВЕТ НА ВАШУ КРИТИКУ
----------------------------------
CRITIC: Not being legal tender, Stamp Scrip will not circulate.

ANSWER: This is an academic remark, for Stamp Scrip does circulate
already.

CRITIC: Very well, it is an attack on the gold standard.

ANSWER: How? The scrip is redeemable in any form of legal tender. It
is not even permanent - it is a temporary, emergency issue, small in amount
and short in duration.

CRITIC: Banks will not take it on deposit because they can't afford
thereafter to go on affixing stamps.

ANSWER: It is an entire misconception to suppose that a socalled deposit
stays in the bank. Banks pay out money as fast as they take it in. If we
relieve them of the next stamp and add a service charge, that is enough.
Experience shows that banks profit not only from the service charge but
from increased business.

CRITIC: If the bank isn't hurt, the user is. Any money costing the
user a stamp and a service charge at the bank is a cheat.

ANSWER: What you call a cheat is a tax (or a quasi-tax) on new business -
and the stamp made the business; without the stamp we wouldn't have the
business.

CRITIC: The Stamp Tax is a sales tax in sheep's clothing. We all hate
sales taxes.

ANSWER: Call it any name you like; it comes out of new business and
it gave us that business - without it we wouldn't have that business.

CRITIC: Two per cent a week is too high.

ANSWER: Not if it comes out of new business. Besides, it's two per
cent divided among many transactions.

CRITIC: Scrip can't be saved - therefore it will encourage reckless
spending.

ANSWER: You are mistaken. You can spend it or invest it or put it in
the bank. The point is: You must do one of these things. You just can't
hoard it, that's all.

CRITIC: But we can't afford to supplant real money.

ANSWER: Scrip supplements rather than supplants. It is an emergency
supply to relieve scarcity till other money condescends to rejoin the service.

CRITIC: By Gresham's law "bad money always drives out good money."
If scrip displaces real money, that proves it is bad money.

ANSWER: No! When Gresham's law is so stated it is misstated, except
as applying to a period of inflation. When, the money supposedly in circulation
doesn't circulate any money which drives it out and really circulates in
its place is not "bad money" but "good money."
